title: Berlin Haskell Reading Group
---

We're a group based in Berlin motivated to learn the
[Haskell][haskell] programming language. Initially proposed by
[Adel][adel], we plan to use the newly released ['Haskell Programming from first principles'][the-book]
as our learning material. The authors come highly recommended, please visit
[Chris Allen's blog][blog] and [Julie Moronuki's blog][blog2] for more information.

We are currently waiting on coupon codes for members of this group to purchase
the book at a reasonable discount. In the mean time, you can check [the offical
sample][sample] to help you decide if you would like to make the purchase.

Join Us
----
Please introduce yourself via the [the meetup group][meetup-group]. Any skill
level is welcome and you can join whenever you want. Please do attend, even
when you didn't get the material covered. We can all still learn something from
each other.


Guidelines
----

The basic idea is as follows:

  * Secure a location and meet every 2 weeks
  * Find a willing Haskell mentor to help face to face
  * Propose a work load for the following meeting
  * Use [our Github issues][iss] to get help between meetings

Note the following:

  * As a fairly loose group, these guidelines may change.
  * There is no official organizer for this group. It's up to us!

When helping another person to solve a problem, please do the following:

  * Don't simply reveal the answer to the problem, lead the person to it.
  * Be helpful and try to cite sources or page numbers that can help the person.
