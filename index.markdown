title: Berlin Haskell Reading Group
---

We're a group based in Berlin motivated to learn the
[Haskell][haskell] programming language. Initially proposed by
[Adel][adel], we plan to use the newly released ['Haskell Programming from first principles'][the-book] 
as our learning material. The author comes highly recommended, please visit
[his blog][blog] to find out more.

We are currently waiting on coupon codes for members of this group to purchase
the book at a reasonable discount. In the mean time, you can check [the offical
sample][sample] to help you decide if you would like to make the purchase.

Dates
-----

 * ~~2016-09-03: [Initial proposal][first-meetup]~~
 * 2016-09-17: [First meeting][second-meetup]
     * Proposed work load: Chapters 1 - 5
     * Location: To Be Anounced

Guidelines
----

The basic idea is as follows:

  * Secure a location and meet every 2 weeks
  * Find a willing Haskell mentor to help face to face
  * Propose a work load for the following meeting
  * Use [our Github issues][iss] to get help between meetings

Note the following:

  * As a fairly loose group, these guidelines may change.
  * There is no official organizer for this group. It's up to us!

Join Us

Please introduce yourself via the [the meetup group][meetup-group]. Any skill
level is welcome and you can join whenever you want. Please do attend, even
when you didn't get the material covered. We can all still learn something from
each other.
